\begin{itemize}
\item expression with models,
\item simple analytical approaches,
\item a little dimensional analysis,
\item how to connect those with experiments, and

\frametitle{So, a Disconnect.}
Specifically, it is impossible to match features like peak population, total population over a year, and turnover rate with a functional form

$$
M(t) = C\sin(\omega t+\theta)
$$

\ldots and these features can be critical to predicting transmission dynamics, and thus planning interventions.

\frametitle{Do Better, But Keep It Simple}
What's appealling about this trigonometric representation?  Simplicity:

\begin{itemize}
\item two parameters
\item no spatial features
\item ``easy'' analytical form
\end{itemize}

Possible to identify alternatives that {\em can} match salient features, but still retain these features?
}

\frame{
What are those salient features?
}

\frame{
\begin{itemize}
\item every year,
\item over a relatively short duration,
\item the mosquito population rapidly increases,
\item sits at a high level of activity,
\item then rapidly declines,
\item apparently connected with resource availability \&\ environmental suitability
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
What's present in the trigonometric formulation?
\begin{itemize}
\item every year, {\bf CHECK!} \ldots {\em but not the rest of:}
\item over a relatively short duration,
\item the mosquito population rapidly increases,
\item sits at a high level of activity,
\item then rapidly declines,
\item apparently connected with resource availability \&\ environmental suitability

\frametitle{``New'' Habits and Tools}
The general arrow of scientific work has been towards increased specialization and collaboration.

This presents a few challenges to getting work done:
\begin{itemize}
\item lashing together methods from different fields,
\item getting genuine peer-review, and
\item the purely mechanical handling of different people simultaneously working on the same ``thing''
\end{itemize}

How can we address these issues?
%.  The final specialist work product can be very intimidating to collaborators with other specialities, which can make a collaboration's skeptical review of their combined product difficult. That's on top of the pure mechanics of handling multiple people modifying the same ``thing''.
% I come from a background where all collaborators are responsible for the entire product, not just their narrowly focused piece
}

\frame{
\frametitle{``New'' Habits and Tools}
Fortunately, there's a whole industry that's continuously tackling this exact problem: software development, and more specifically open-source software projects.

What tools and habits can we adopt from this field?  What risks are associated with that?  What's still missing?
}

\frame{
\frametitle{The Good}
\begin{itemize}
\item version control systems,
\item collaborative tools on top of those,
\item preference for code documentation leading to
\begin{itemize}
\item bite-sized parts,
\item modularity,
\item re-usability, and
\item verifiability (a/k/a unit testing)
\end{itemize}
\item open availability of all source,
\item combines with version control to provide complete history of work product
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{The Bad}
\begin{itemize}
\item openness can make for opportunity to be ``scooped'',
\item can focus more on process than product,
\item learning curve for most scientists
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{The Ugly}
\begin{itemize}
\item university contracts' intellectual property clauses,
\item academic institutions don't ``get'' these tools,
\item community adoption?
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Why bring this up?}
It's a little bit advocacy, and \href{https://github.com/pearsonca/moz-model-pres}{I built this presentation using this work model.}
